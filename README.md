Hey, think of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) as these cool hubs that keep our electric cars charged up and ready to roll all day long. Absolutely, ensuring our electric rides get a smooth charge is top priority, especially with more folks zipping around town in EVs. According to a CNBC report, over half of all new cars sold in the U.S. by 2030 are expected to be electric vehicles, which could put a major strain on our nation’s electric grid. We want everyone to enjoy their drive without stressing over running out of energy, don't we?

So, to keep the EV party going strong, it's essential to predict how much energy these charging stations are going to need. This not only ensures the reliability of electric vehicle charging but also contributes to the overall stability and sustainability of the power grid. That's where fancy computer models come in! This study dives into using some deep learning models – a mix of naive forecast methods and some smart deep learning ones – to predict exactly how much energy those EV charging stations are going to use up each day. With this info, we can inform the power grid in advance and make sure it generates power that's not too little and not too much - we also don't want to waste it!
